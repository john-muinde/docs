Kotani Pay sends webhook notifications to inform your application about various events such as transaction status updates, payment confirmations, and other important system events.

## Webhook Events

You can configure webhook endpoints in your dashboard to receive notifications for:

- **Transaction Status Updates**: Notifications when deposits, withdrawals, or transfers change status
- **Payment Confirmations**: Real-time confirmations of successful payments
- **KYC Status Changes**: Updates when customer KYC verification status changes
- **System Events**: Important system notifications and maintenance updates

## Webhook Format

All webhooks are sent as HTTP POST requests with the following structure:

```json
{
  "event": "transaction.status.updated",
  "data": {
    "reference_id": "ABC123",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "amount": 1000,
    "currency": "KES",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  },
  "signature": "sha256=abc123..."
}
```

## Security

All webhook payloads are signed with your webhook secret. Verify the signature to ensure the webhook is from Kotani Pay:

1. Get the signature from the `X-Kotani-Signature` header
2. Calculate the expected signature using your webhook secret
3. Compare the signatures to verify authenticity

## Configuration

Configure your webhook endpoints in the Kotani Pay dashboard:

1. Log into your dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > Webhooks
3. Add your webhook URL and select events
4. Save your webhook secret for signature verification
